# CI/CD Integration for Docker & Kubernetes via Jenkins


## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm. The pipeline is designed to automate the entire process of building, testing, and deploying applications in a Kubernetes environment, ensuring a streamlined and efficient workflow from code integration to production deployment.


### Key Technologies
Jenkins: Used to orchestrate the CI/CD pipeline, managing the various stages of code integration, testing, and deployment.
Docker: Employed to containerize the applications, ensuring consistency and reliability across different environments.
Kubernetes: Acts as the orchestration platform, managing the deployment, scaling, and operation of containerized applications.
Helm: Utilized to simplify the deployment and management of Kubernetes applications through templated configuration files.
